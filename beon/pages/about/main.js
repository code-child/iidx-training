                        Ideally, this community envisions a less intense environment, appealing to be friendlier towards newcomers.

                        The huge arcade is located on 3rd floor of ÆON Mall BSD CIty near Samsung Store and Cinema XXI (3F-16,17,18). You could see a giant Twister and a robot as the main entrance once you've arrived at the destination.

                        <p className="mt-6 font-medium w-full text-gray-700">
                        BEON was created due to the first BEMANI game introduced to this new market inside the arcade, <span className="inline-block mt-0 rounded-lg font-medium text-pink-800 bg-pink-100 px-2 relative">Beatmania IIDX</span>. 
                        We’re all aware that IIDX is an intense and competitive game with communities well known for living up to the tenacity of its very competitive nature against others and yourself. 
                        </p> <br />
                        <p className="font-medium w-full text-gray-700">
                        As many newcomers are more likely to feel intimidated towards how challenging this game can be, it is also highly notable that the community aspect also impacts the openness towards newcomers and potential long term players who are interested.

                        <p className="mt-6 font-medium w-full text-gray-700">
                        After IIDX came into the arcade, another BEMANI game introduced had been <span className="inline-block mt-0 rounded-lg font-medium text-pink-800 bg-pink-100 px-2 relative">Sound Voltex</span>. 
                        We've seen that SDVX is also an intense and competitive game with communities well known from various games despite it's easier than IIDX.
                        </p><br />
                        <p className="font-medium w-full text-gray-700">
                        As SDVX conquered the current BEMANI Indonesia market, we hope to create a strong foundation and a well-established local group (not just the big umbrella) for newcomers and potential players to find comfort in approaching as well.

                        <p className="font-medium w-full text-gray-700">
                        The nature of BEON hopefully can grow into one that is openly <span className="inline-block mt-0 rounded-lg font-medium text-pink-800 bg-pink-100 px-2 relative">supportive</span> to brand new players. 
                        We hope to establish this through a tamer mentoring mindset from the experienced players, sharing methods and being positively encouraging while still maintaining a good level of competitiveness and lighthearted vibes to let players discover the <span className="inline-block mt-0 rounded-lg font-medium text-pink-800 bg-pink-100 px-2 relative">real fun</span> behind the game and still progress at their own preferred pace.
